# Simulation-of-Disk-Scheduling-Algorithms
A project implementing and comparing different disk scheduling algorithms, including First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), SCAN (Elevator Algorithm), and LOOK (Optimized SCAN). Written in C, the project simulates how these algorithms handle disk I/O requests, with sample inputs, outputs, and analysis included.
